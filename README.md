# baltra
A project for the exploration and demonstration of ideas involving temporal databases

## A few notes

1. This project's goal primarily to test and demonstrate some ideas rather than provide 
production code. If you *choose* to use it in a production setting I'd be interested to hear about it,
but note that I'm unlikely to merge a pull request that detracts from the research value of the code, 
even if it does make it more suitable for production use.

2. This code is developed and tested only with Python 3.7. (See item 1.) At this point the only thing
that definitely requires 3.7 is the test code.
